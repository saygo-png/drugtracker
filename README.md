# drugtracker
Tiny terminal app for tracking when you last took a pill written in bash script
## What it does
It shows you a list of 5 last entries, and how much time passed since the last one in hours and minutes.
Then it asks if you would like to create a new entry, if so, it asks for it's name
Then it creates entries.txt in ~/.config/drugreminder/
## Usage
Make the file executable, and run it.
## Why
i made this because my sleep schedule is rotating and thus any medication cant be taken "at 8 every morning", it has to be relative for me.
